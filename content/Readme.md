# I. The Practice of Medicine
테스트 1
### - The Science And Art of Medicine
> - Deciding whether a clinical clue is worth pursuing or should be dismissed as a "red herring" and weighing whether a proposed test, preventive measure, or treatment entails a greater risk than the disease itself are essential judgments that a skilled clinician must make many times each day. 
### - Clinical Skills
> - History-Taking
> - Physical Examination
> - Diagnostic Studies
> 	- Physicians generally request "batteries" of multiple test. 
> 	- Simple laboratory determinations such as routine serum chemistries, blood counts, and urinalysis, often provide a major clue to the presence of a pathologic process. 
> 	- Patients must endure each of these test, and the added cost of unnecessary testing is substantial. 

### - Management of Patient Care
> - Team-Based Care
> - The Dichotomy of Inpatient and Outpatient Internal Medicine

### Maintaining Humanism and Professionalism
> - vigorous efforts to reduce the escalating costs of health care
> - the growing number of managed care program; the patient may have little choice in selecting a physician 
> - increasing reliance on technological advances and other computerization
> - the need for numerous physicians and other health professionals to be involved in the care of most patients who are seriously ill. 
> - Physician's contract with society:
> 	- The primacy of patient welfare
> 	- Patient autonomy
> 	- Social Justice
> Physicians should be alert to their own reactions.
> ⭐Patient's "Quality of Life"

### Expanding Frontiers in Medical Practice
### -The Era of "Omics"
> Genomics in the diagnosis is still in early satges.
> Molecular medicine
> 	- Epigenetics, 
> 	- Microbiomics( +Metagenomics: The genomic study of environmental species that have the potential to influence human biology. )
> 	- Metabolomics: The study of the range of metabolites in cells or orans. ex) aging process, disease associated patterns(lipid, carbohydrates, membranes, mitochondria…)
> 	- Exposomics: The study of the environmental exposure(smoking, sunlight, diet, exercise, education…)

> 💡Since "Omics" are evolving so rapidly, physicians and other health care professionals must engage in continuous learning so that they can apply this new knowledge to the benefit their patients' health and well-being.

### The Globalization of Medicine
- Climate change, migration, refugees…

### Medicine on the Internet

### Public Expectations and Accountability
> Physicians are held accountable not only for the technical aspects of the care they provide but also for their patients' satisfaction with the delivery and costs of care. 

### Medical Ethics and New Technologies
>💡Potential to modify inherited predisposition to disease
> - Genetic engineering
> - Cloning
> - Gene therapy
> - Human-computer interfaces
> - Replace failing tissues
> - augment "normal" performance
> - prolong life span

# II. Promoting Good Health
### Goals And Approaches to Prevention
> The ultimate goal of preventive strategies is to avoid premature death. Given that all patients will eventually die, the goal of prevention ultimately becomes compression of morbidity toward the end of the lifespan; that is, reduction of the amount of burden and time spent with disease prior to dying. Successful prevention offers the opportunity both to extend life and to extend healthy life, thus "squaring the curve" of health loss during aging.

> Prevention Stage
> I. Tertiary Prevention
>> Tertiary stage requires rapid action to prevent imminent death in setting of actual illness, such as through percutaneous coronary intervention in the setting of ST-segment elevated myocardiac infarction. 
> II. Secondary Prevention 
>> Secondary prevention strategies focus on avoiding the recurrence of disease and death in an individual who is already affected. 
>> Example
>> Tamoxifen is recommended for women with surgically treated early stage, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer, because it reduces the risk of recurrent breast cancer (including in the contralateral breast) and death. 
>III. Primary Prevention
>>Primary revention attempts to reduce the risk of incident disease among individual with a risk factor. 
>> Example
>> Treatment of elevated blood pressure in individuals who have not yet experienced cardiovascular disease represents one example of primary prevention that has proven effective in reducing the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease. 
>IV. Primordial Prevention
>> Primordial prevention is a more recent concept which focuses on prevntion of the development of risk factors for disease, not just prevention of disease. 
>> Example
>> Upstream determinants - eating patterns, physical activity, environmental and social determinants. 

> [!NOTE]
> 💡One risk factors develop, it is difficult to restore risk to the low level of someone who never developed the risk factor. 
> 💡Conversely, individuals who maintain optimal levels of all major cardiovascular risk factors into middle age through primordial prevention essentially abolish their lifetime risk of developing cardiovascular disease while also living substantially longer and having a lower burden of other comorbid illness. 

> Example: Individuals with hypertension who are treated back to optimal levels(<120/<80mmHg) do have a lower risk compared with untreated patients with hypertension, but they still have twice the risk of cardiovascular events as those who maintained optimal blood pressure without medication. 

### Health Promotion
💡Health is somewhat subjective, but attempts have been made to use more objective criteria to define health in order to raise awareness, prevent disease, and promote healthy longevity. 
> American Heart Association(AHA) - Definition of cardiovascular health based on seven health factors and behaviors. 
> 1. Eating pattern
> 2. Physical activity
> 3. Body mass
> 4. Smoking status
> 5. Level of blood pressure
> 6. Level of blood cholesterol
> 7. Level of blood glucose

💡Focusing on health promotion rather than just disease prevention, may also provide greater motivation for patients to pursue life style changes or adhere to clinicians recommendations.
